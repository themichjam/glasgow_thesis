I owe thanks to many people. 

First to my supervisors Nick Bailey and Jo Ferrie for their support through everything. Without their encouragement, guidance and understanding, this work wouldn’t exist.

Second, to the original survey participants, who probably don’t know how their data is being used, and probably don’t know about this work, I think about them often and where they are now. 

Third, to Iain Atherton and Nadine Dougall at SCADR and Napier for their unending support during the last part of this work, and for their guidance in a system I know nothing of. And to Jan for the hand of friendship, coffee, and stats chat. 

To the “Glasgow Uni people” who provided support, advice, and friendship, even during the hard times – Kirstie, Stephanie, Johanna, David, April, Evan, Simona, and all of the Urban Studies PhDers and Dept. 

To the “Priesthill people” who even though bemused by my doing this, are the first to defend it – especially Gordon, who’s friendship has survived since nursery. 

To Time and Space and everyone there who’s sat with me in that circle since 2017, especially Elaine and Lindsay.  I wouldn’t have been able to navigate the mental health stuff without you. And to Karolina for every single Wednesday. You helped me understand myself when I thought I never would again.

For my nieces, Orlah and Jorgie Jamieson, who were born during this work and have been involved in more conversations about this topic than they even realized. For the rest of my family, Mum, my wee brother Jack, Gran, Granda Joe, Aunties Kim, Tracey, Josephine and Helen, my Dad. They might not have got why I wanted to do this, but were there for me nonetheless.

I rescued a dog (the "PhD support pet") during this process. I named him Sigmund and he’s the best. 

I didn’t think I’d see this PhD get done and handed in, so that’s something.
